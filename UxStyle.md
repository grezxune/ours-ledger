# Ours Ledger UX Style Guide

## Product Feel
- Confident, calm, and practical.
- Designed for couples who operate as one financial team.
- Tone: transparent, grounded, never judgmental.

## Design Principles
- Shared-first: always show household context before individual context.
- Decision clarity: surface tradeoffs and consequences directly in plain language.
- Friction where it helps: confirmations for destructive actions, low friction for routine tracking.

## Color Direction
- Primary: `#2D7C57`
- Primary dark: `#195D3E`
- Surface light: `#F4F7F2`
- Surface dark: `#0F1714`
- Text light mode: `#152B28`
- Text dark mode: `#ECF5EF`

## Typography
- Sans: Manrope (UI, labels, data displays)
- Serif: Fraunces (headlines, key value statements)

## Spacing & Layout
- Prioritize breathing room around balances and decisions.
- Use cards and sectioning for cognitive chunking.
- No horizontal page overflow. Root layout must enforce `overflow-x: hidden`.

## Motion
- Subtle, meaning-driven transitions only.
- Use motion to indicate state change (saved, synced, alerted), not decoration.

## Accessibility
- WCAG 2.2 AA contrast minimum.
- Keyboard accessible navigation, menus, modals, and critical workflows.
- Avoid color-only status indicators; pair with text or iconography.

## Open Brand Questions
- Should the brand direction stay natural/earthy or shift to a more premium fintech aesthetic?
- Should we use illustration, photography, or icon-only storytelling for onboarding?
