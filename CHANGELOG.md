# Changelog

## [0.2.60] - 2026-03-04

- Completed the app-wide migration away from route-level server actions to live Convex client patterns: dashboard invite acceptance, entity overview, audits index/detail, and super-admin storage configuration now run through reactive queries plus client-side submission/mutation flows.
- Added API route handlers for non-Convex side effects that still require server execution (`/api/admin/storage/configure` and entity document upload route) so interactive forms remain instant without redirect roundtrips.
- Removed legacy `src/app/**/actions.ts` files and added architecture guardrails to prevent regressions:
  - ESLint restriction that forbids `"use server"` directives in `src`.
  - Automated test coverage that fails if route action modules or server-action directives reappear in non-API app routes.

## [0.2.59] - 2026-03-04

- Added a client-side Auth.js-to-Convex bridge: global `ConvexAuthProvider`, a new token endpoint (`/api/auth/convex/token`), and a shared `useAuthUser` hook for canonical `userId` binding in client queries/mutations.
- Migrated entity transactions from server-action redirects to reactive Convex client queries + client mutations with optimistic updates, so saves render immediately in-place.
- Migrated the entity budget workspace to reactive Convex client queries and client mutations with optimistic updates for budget/income/recurring-expense operations, removing post-save redirect latency in that workflow.
- Kept success confirmation UX by updating the existing query-driven toast signal client-side (no full page reload required).
- Added unit/integration coverage for the new Convex token endpoint identity derivation and HTTP behavior.

## [0.2.58] - 2026-03-03

- Added a shared query-driven toast system (`ToastCenter`) inside `AppShell` to provide consistent post-submit success feedback across routes.
- Introduced typed navigation helpers for toast redirects (`src/lib/navigation/toast.ts`) and standardized toast key/message handling.
- Updated server-action success redirects across entity creation/update, budget CRUD flows, transaction creation, member invite flows, document upload, dashboard invite acceptance, and super-admin storage validation to include toast metadata.
- Changed entity creation success navigation to land on the new entity overview (`/entity/[id]`) instead of manage tools, with a creation success toast.

## [0.2.57] - 2026-03-03

- Hardened Convex authorization by introducing shared wrapper-based guards (`authenticated*` and `superAdmin*`) and applying them across public queries/mutations.
- Added Convex custom JWT auth provider config (`convex/auth.config.ts`) with RS256 validation against a new JWKS endpoint at `/api/auth/convex/jwks`.
- Added server-side Convex actor token minting (`src/lib/auth/convex-token.ts`) and switched all server data access modules to authenticated Convex clients.
- Removed insecure Auth.js secret fallback behavior and now fail closed when neither `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` nor `AUTH_SECRET` is configured.
- Restricted developer credentials provider to non-production and removed default passphrase fallback.
- Hardened user upsert/audit/storage flows to rely on authenticated identity and server-authorized `userId` binding.
- Added unit/integration coverage for Convex JWT minting and JWKS route responses.

## [0.2.56] - 2026-02-26

- Kept desktop compact table + inline add-row behavior while ensuring planned income and recurring expense components stay visually in sync across breakpoints.

## [0.2.55] - 2026-02-26

- Added responsive recurring planned expense layouts: stacked mobile rendering for existing rows and stacked mobile creation form to prevent right-side overflow on small screens.
- Kept compact table + inline-row entry pattern on `md+` while ensuring no required recurring-expense interactions depend on horizontal scrolling.

## [0.2.54] - 2026-02-26

- Upgraded shared `SelectField` to support keyboard type-to-jump matching against option labels.
- Moved select dropdown menus to a `document.body` portal with fixed positioning so menus overlay above all layout containers.
- Added viewport-aware select menu positioning data (top/left/width/max-height) with automatic open-up/open-down behavior and scroll/resize re-measurement.

## [0.2.53] - 2026-02-26

- Added server-action compatibility fallback for budget line-item updates when Convex `budgets/incomeMutations:*` functions are unavailable in the current deployment.
